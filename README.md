# Mathematics Collection

The goal this is project is to write up *all* of mathematics (*cough cough*) in a great
document, where we start from set-theory and build fields like linear algebra, 
real analysis, topology and differential geometry, discrete mathematics, complexity theory
and all the things in general. This is largely based on the mathematics 
bachelor programme available at TUGraz & Karl Franzens Universit√§t (both situated in
Graz, Austria). However any (reviewed) additions are welcome.

The text is written in LaTeX, using the **prettytex** suite of latex styles,
which can be found [here](https://github.com/MrP01/prettytex). A minimalistic 
coding style will soon (tba) be written up as to maintain some sense of maintainability and
keep an overview over everything (i.e. don't write everything in one 400kB file).
